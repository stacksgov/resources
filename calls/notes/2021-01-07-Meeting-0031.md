1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:09.300
Jenny: Okay. Hi everybody, welcome to the governance working group call number 31 I never know whether that number is accurate. I just say it.

2
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:23.520
Jenny: On the agenda. So thank you, thanks for updating that. Today is Thursday, January 7 2021 and it's just after noon eastern time here, and I'm on with Jason and Brian

3
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:31.890
Jenny: We have a little bit of a smaller groups day I assume that's because we're just getting back from the holidays, which which makes sense. So I know some

4
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:39.900
Jenny: Group members couldn't attend. And so we're anticipating this meeting will be pretty short and sweet, but we'll spend some time talking about

5
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:52.860
Jenny: Our current work streams and starting to discuss our plans or goals for the upcoming quarter. So with that we'll go into stand ups just going to go down the list here.

6
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.170
Jenny: On first on the list. Okay.

7
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.240
Jenny: For said that

8
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:12.090
Jenny: I haven't been working on anything to intensively and in regards to governance related work a lot of focus has been on the upcoming main that launch event which is next Thursday. That's really exciting. I'm sure that when that hits

9
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:30.270
Jenny: There will be a lot of inspiration for governance work to come and but as of now, the main thing I've been doing is trying to make sure that the auto moderation bot is on track. This week we were supposed to hit a mile or we did hit a milestone, or we were meant to

10
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:39.030
Jenny: Four defining different community management bowls that is behind, although I don't think development of the body itself and

11
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.520
Jenny: readiness to deploy the body itself is behind. So we're just trying to play catch up with that. And once we get all of those

12
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:56.940
Jenny: Criteria and community management profiles on paper, we can share that with the community, specifically the folks who are testing the bot in the test server.

13
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:07.890
Jenny: And and and we can also publish those criteria on the forum just everyone can get eyes on it. And then after that, we'll get ready to deploy it to the actual server.

14
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:17.670
Jenny: So that's where we're at with the moderation, but if there are any questions, everyone would like to join the test server before we move forward on deployment fees.

15
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.880
Jenny: messaged me underscore. Yeah, that does it for my stand up. No blockers, other than the one that I mentioned with just being behind on that milestone.

16
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:38.730
Jenny: And that really depends on Ross. Who's leading that and over the next few weeks, I expect us to deploy the bot to the server and have a lot more community members test it out.

17
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.010
Jenny: Okay, that's my unit, Jason. Would you like to go next.

18
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.860
Jason Schrader: Yes. And thank you for that. I know I owe you a little bit of time on that box. So I will need to kind of jump in there. Look again.

19
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.350
Jason Schrader: But really, really cool effort and excited to see that coming out. So it's good to good to hear some updates there.

20
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:08.430
Jason Schrader: For me, my stand up this week I have actually been working through my grant proposal. So for anybody who hasn't seen that. It's just a bunch of GitHub clean up everything from

21
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.470
Jason Schrader: All the different repos to standard operating procedures to a whole bunch of pieces.

22
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:22.590
Jason Schrader: The party finished now I just updated some copy where we changed names like last night to stacks and fixing typos fix some issues and some link problems.

23
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:33.810
Jason Schrader: So that parts done first milestone is complete of moving on to the second milestone for that and have the whole process is actually on the projects board here in the project management repository.

24
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.980
Jason Schrader: So if anybody wants to peek in or if there are other issues to be open, that kind of go along with the content. I definitely welcome that along the way.

25
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.090
Jason Schrader: And no blockers. At this point, it's just a, it's a busy time the road domain that is a fun one. And it's

26
00:03:48.540 --> 00:04:00.660
Jason Schrader: It's exciting all at the same time, though, so I'm really I think it's really cool. What we have coming out of there. And over the next two weeks, I will just be moving down that milestone list and having fun. As we get really, really close alone.

27
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.340
Jason Schrader: That's it for me.

28
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.720
Jenny: Thanks. Jason Ryan Would you like to give your stand up.

29
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.490
Ryan Arndt: Sure. So the stuff I've been working on mostly is related to getting the foundation

30
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:30.900
Ryan Arndt: Website and the grants.io setup for Maine and launch coming next week. We did a day. And so just doing that part's been focus a blockers around that. Not too much, just, I'm kind of keeping everything moving

31
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.570
Ryan Arndt: From after we shot for Mitchell for the rest of you, or just change with the

32
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:44.430
Ryan Arndt: Defiant getting that sorted out until though, but nothing too crazy that I don't think endures all fairly quickly. So

33
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.760
Ryan Arndt: As for what will happen next two weeks, the Cross and say things may have lunch and then

34
00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:01.050
Ryan Arndt: Excited to have the separation ecosystem, the staffing system call today as well. And those good so she leaned into next week's big event.

35
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:14.490
Ryan Arndt: And then we'll have one the week following information. He says target. So yeah, keeping things moving and getting back into regular schedule post holidays do so. Yeah, it is kind of like forever Mondays, a little bit right now.

36
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.100
Jenny: I see that

37
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.980
Jenny: Joins Harold, are you there.

38
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.040
Ryan Arndt: It is three participants in one year.

39
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.490
Oh,

40
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:42.210
Jenny: Well, nevermind then I'm sure will join later I can give a stand up then. Okay. Actually, Ryan. So I know you just gave your, your stand up. Is there anything you'd like to add, since you're here from the foundation and could potentially give a foundation update as well.

41
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:55.650
Ryan Arndt: Sure. Yeah. So it's just like I say, No, we're really just focusing on the Grants Program at this time as we have been and getting information out that out there to more and more people as well as

42
00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:07.470
Ryan Arndt: It's done. Jason is yesterday because we want the grants program to have granted I have to have stacks login. And so that's going to be for grant as well. So it's very

43
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.080
Ryan Arndt: That that exhibit mean with it, you know, having a grant, grant sort of thing.

44
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:29.790
Ryan Arndt: But yeah, so really focusing on that and getting that website set up that's really been working on moving towards me an income supporting the whole ecosystem where possible around that to make sure that people have with me get content out

45
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.920
Ryan Arndt: Yeah, so it's nothing.

46
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:49.680
Ryan Arndt: Nothing to the ordinary for this kind of non Ordinary Time because. But yeah, it's really extraordinary time and yeah So continuing with the, the usual grants that to reviews on Tuesday. So nothing different than that.

47
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.180
Ryan Arndt: Yeah, and excited as are wrapping sending out some

48
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.870
Ryan Arndt: Some mailers to grab seconds to so I think

49
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:58.650
Ryan Arndt: Jason, do we get

50
00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.250
Ryan Arndt: So those two

51
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:08.760
Jenny: Things. Right. Right. And if there are no questions, we can go into action items.

52
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:18.780
Jason Schrader: I think so. Actually, we can hit those stacks foundation ones real there's any updates, but I do like to just show them forget them.

53
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:30.540
Jenny: Okay, so the community board seat and the call for for nominations, I believe we cover this in our last meeting. And have there been any development since we can look at them.

54
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:40.680
Ryan Arndt: As far as I know, you know, Sean was going to look at that further. But I think the holidays. Put a wrench in things like know the range.

55
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:41.940
Jenny: Holiday, of course, but

56
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:49.770
Jenny: Yeah, okay. So it's in everyone caught up last

57
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:57.780
Jenny: Bit of this conversation is between Brittany and Sean, it sounds like Sean is going to take the lead on something here.

58
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.970
Ryan Arndt: Yeah okay he's definitely the most on top of it.

59
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:19.950
Jenny: Okay, great. So hopefully he's on the next call or we can get some updates on discord, but for anyone who wants to catch up on this community board seat issue. We can look through this thread and issue number 66 and the foundation repo.

60
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.950
Jenny: Now, there's the world.

61
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.310
Jenny: And for nominations. I'm

62
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.470
Jason Schrader: Just an open call

63
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:39.180
Jason Schrader: They can still be submitted and it's something that it remains open all the time. So that's when we can kind of go over real quick.

64
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:40.920
Jenny: Okay.

65
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.790
Jason Schrader: Skip over

66
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:50.700
Jenny: I figured statement. Okay, see here has joined Harold. We just finished our stand ups but would you like to give yours.

67
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.190
Harold Davis: Set up on another computer has given me a big problems.

68
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:14.670
Harold Davis: But yeah, some, it's good to see everybody and I've been working on a few things. So happy to give a stand up here and the first thing comes to mind is yesterday, we

69
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.350
Harold Davis: Met with meta god I was happy to see line there.

70
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:34.890
Harold Davis: And we didn't speak or present or anything, but that is the plan in order to get things rolling with integration that they've offered which I could speak more on a little bit later on to go along with some of the things that we

71
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:42.300
Harold Davis: presented here before with a wide chat and policy kit options for voting mechanism.

72
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.170
Harold Davis: So yeah, that was exciting on and

73
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:58.350
Harold Davis: Yeah. So the idea would be to you know get a timeframe. Pretty soon on exactly how long we can get something to tinker with terms of community experiments.

74
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.950
Harold Davis: You know, for the voting mechanism.

75
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.770
Harold Davis: And so, you know, the plan is to, you know, communicate via a slack.

76
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:22.620
Harold Davis: Channel that they have. I was having some problems getting connected with it, but hopefully I can get that done today and I'm get that under going on but also excited to show you guys some source cred stuff that I've been doing over the last few weeks.

77
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:29.280
Harold Davis: Some of you might be familiar with it on lane mentioned it a while back now.

78
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:46.830
Harold Davis: I think, in reference to, you know, the community mod, but it has some really interesting things that may open up some modest quadratic decision making or voting for us when it comes to the voting mechanism. And I've already got an instance setup.

79
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.440
Harold Davis: So I think it makes a good option for tinkering with the

80
00:10:53.670 --> 00:11:07.950
Harold Davis: You know option to admit suggested for, you know, ranked choice for the voting mechanism as an option to to experiment with. And so I'm excited to show that a little bit later on as well.

81
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.810
Harold Davis: So it has three plugins, which is really exciting our GitHub.

82
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:18.930
Harold Davis: So it scrapes all the data from these different plugins and you're able to then you know

83
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:35.880
Harold Davis: Play with different flows of value of contributions that that happen in these different platforms via reactions or comments for requests or whatever the different plugin offered. So with discord as well. There's a plugin and with

84
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:55.080
Harold Davis: Let's see discourse, the form which is exciting because of the stacks off that we have on the forum which isn't another scene if it's working. I saw some things that it was some books and problems. Recently, but hopefully it's backup worker soon or they already is. And then they know

85
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.940
Harold Davis: If the weather.

86
00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.880
Ryan Arndt: Is back of it's going to be a bit probably

87
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.840
Harold Davis: Ok, ok, ready on down the line. This is

88
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.090
Harold Davis: Interesting for voting mechanism.

89
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:11.010
Harold Davis: You know, before building something from scratch, if, if necessary.

90
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:19.860
Harold Davis: As a means to one of the other things that Jude suggested originally. So yes, I'm excited to show what source Chris can do

91
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:30.060
Harold Davis: Part of the reason why I'm late. I had a I believe zoom had a problem with the local server had running the background, but I'm hoping I can demo something for you guys today still

92
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.500
Harold Davis: And with the local with the instance and

93
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:45.570
Harold Davis: See other other exciting news has to do with a date that just got a stamped this morning with Ronnie blush and working with the sting.

94
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:53.820
Harold Davis: Project and the prototype with the longhouse and indigenous Council mentioned before, for the 12th.

95
00:12:54.450 --> 00:13:00.900
Harold Davis: Tuesday upcoming so excited to announce that here for anybody interested as a starting point to getting involved.

96
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:12.600
Harold Davis: For the folks that are interested in any capacity and add some more updates there as well. Later on, so yeah, I'll try to keep it there, but um yeah thank you coming. I'm glad I mean

97
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.920
Jenny: anything's Harold, what's a great update

98
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:17.760
Harold Davis: Yes.

99
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:26.130
Jenny: We're definitely going to follow up interested in that meeting on the 12th and I'm sure everyone else is interested in going to so we can evolve with you and

100
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:38.490
Jenny: Discord and obviously you'll have your demo later so you can speak more to this after the word right okay so we can go back to action items quick

101
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:52.950
Jenny: The, like I mentioned, the beginning of the call will have a huge group. So I think that was the same thing. We can and we don't have a ton of action items, either. I assume thanks to Jason, so we can just go over these typically

102
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.770
Jason Schrader: Jason. Yes, I can.

103
00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:04.620
Jason Schrader: I can go real quick for these two. They're basically their later phases of the grant that I'll be looking at both where we can host our GitHub pages which

104
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:14.520
Jason Schrader: Is currently online, but the domains, a bit long and then meeting conference software selection will kind of revisit that topic. I think it's in milestone five or six. So both of those are on my list.

105
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.900
Jason Schrader: And probably the coolest thing that I could show off real quick is we'll just hit new issue.

106
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.950
Jason Schrader: We added some issue templates to help people add oh

107
00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:24.480
That's okay.

108
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.320
Jason Schrader: We can we can do it on another time, another call

109
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:38.280
Jason Schrader: And but basically when you hit new issue. There are there are four issue templates, one for the agenda, one for an action item discussion item or a stacks foundation item.

110
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:43.170
Jason Schrader: When you create the issue that way. It gives you a little bit of context on what each one should be four.

111
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:53.070
Jason Schrader: And it will automatically apply the label. So it'll show up in our meetings and everything else. So that was what I what I just pushed yesterday that should help out with the flow of things a bit

112
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.320
Jenny: Anything. Thanks, Jason.

113
00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:08.010
Ryan Arndt: So what if there's a way to get that. So I mean it along. Right. I wonder if there's a way to get that. So it was like push it to grants.io so like one of them came up and like get this is grammar.

114
00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:19.410
Jason Schrader: Yeah, I mean, GitHub does support web hooks. I don't know what information we have to be sent back and forth, but there are some really cool things you can do. So, you know, down the road. We can look at playing with that.

115
00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:25.470
Harold Davis: No, it was excited to see that this morning was making the issue of, like, Wow, this is

116
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.460
Nice.

117
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:35.250
Jason Schrader: Awesome. Well, I appreciate that and i don't i don't think we have anything else in in action. If we want to go in and move on to

118
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.210
Jason Schrader: Discussion items.

119
00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:37.200
Cool.

120
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.200
Jenny: Okay, I think this is

121
00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.750
Jenny: Gonna go over this quickly here.

122
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:50.700
Harold Davis: Just

123
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.210
Harold Davis: briefly mentioned it already.

124
00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:06.510
Harold Davis: Added the link that I was attached to a previous issue that was closed before and I would you know recreate an issue where that where that link to that to that grant draftees

125
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:18.900
Harold Davis: But also gave some some updates that are also on that, on that draft as to what we're currently doing as as it relates to the indigenous Council then the grant application idea that we had

126
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:37.560
Harold Davis: The current updates or just to, you know, to split it up for clarity. There's a lot going on in this graph and you know it's from lessons for, you know, exceeding this working group that it would, you know, maximize participation and clarity, particularly

127
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:44.130
Harold Davis: If we if we did some splitting up, particularly for the folks that were working with at the at the

128
00:16:44.790 --> 00:17:04.410
Harold Davis: At the Council and other folks that we hope to get involved so that it's a, you know, not so much in one but in as well, you know, getting that much more resources Grant was as well. But yeah, the goal is to still Chino try to get you know this in for for this to this beta

129
00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:14.640
Harold Davis: But there's also some, you know, other grants. We that I have in mind as well. In addition to this, I don't, I might have some time to speak about it later.

130
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:19.290
Harold Davis: I've got the machine my stand up as long, along with the blockers ago

131
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:28.530
Harold Davis: But yes, that's the message is to have this update in terms of you know folks that are that want to get involved with this particular grant

132
00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.980
Harold Davis: As it relates to this working group or the community.

133
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:42.750
Harold Davis: The first meeting with Ronnie glass would be, you know, a tremendous helping regards to digital fabrication, as well as, you know, you know, bottom up.

134
00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:46.350
Harold Davis: Economics and governance.

135
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:56.010
Harold Davis: You know and as well as you know, applying indigenous modes into esteem education.

136
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:10.980
Harold Davis: You know platform that she has plenty of experiencing so anybody's experienced in this end as well as attention. No web three infrastructure that's mentioned here in this application to help sustain it hopefully

137
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:21.060
Harold Davis: As a, as an important model to show to the ecosystem snacks ecosystem. And what's possible with high value data, the, this is interesting, please.

138
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:26.490
Harold Davis: Make use of this week and we'll be happy to have you on Tuesday.

139
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.100
Ryan Arndt: And one thing

140
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:37.980
Ryan Arndt: Carol those just looking at this, like looking at over because the grand committee. LAUGHTER Look at it. Right. And so some of them will not have any familiarity like luckily

141
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:53.520
Ryan Arndt: Some meetings there with the two of them council and stuff, but the for some folks. They won't know what Fab Lab is and stuff like that. So if you have more info in there about that for folks who are completely unfamiliar, they've got for the rank for sure for getting review.

142
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.480
Harold Davis: You soon.

143
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.200
Harold Davis: Them will be splitting it up and

144
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:17.160
Harold Davis: They'll be probably some changes to who's involved, it will probably be going forward with Ronnie lashing has a lot of the same experience. I found the can, you would be able to give us right away, since he's been able to respond to equip you so you're so excited about about me before.

145
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:34.140
Jenny: Anyone wants a little more background on that and you can look at and discussion. Item number 125

146
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:47.370
Jenny: This one, I believe there were some updates here from both Harold enjoy yet and Harold. I think that you covered a lot of your updates. Is there anything that you want to add this looks new yeah

147
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.530
Jenny: Do you want to go for that.

148
00:19:50.910 --> 00:20:00.720
Harold Davis: It's just so yes there's some some updates on the little bit above here as well. But there's some screenshots there the discourse.

149
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.470
Harold Davis: Plugin actually being loaded into the instance

150
00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:22.680
Harold Davis: I think I found the connected on zoom. I might be able to give you guys a demo as well here, but the it's it's very interesting. As you can see, can play with weights there and they have this very interesting graph architecture where they

151
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.920
Harold Davis: Describe it. As you know nodes and edges.

152
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:31.740
Harold Davis: And you know the it's they describe it as, you know, equilibrium

153
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:42.870
Harold Davis: Similar to like water systems where you know the edges represent the connections between ponds, which will be the nodes and there's always cred.

154
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:54.390
Harold Davis: Flowing and you know keeping equilibrium depending on you know what's happening in reaction wise in the respective plugin that you're in.

155
00:20:55.830 --> 00:21:05.580
Harold Davis: But it. There's also some interesting things because this credit is attached to grain and this grain, you know, can be used in a in a in a

156
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.220
Harold Davis: In a token mechanism you know that

157
00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.830
Harold Davis: Can be attached, but also

158
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:23.430
Harold Davis: You know, it could just be used for point you can call it points and use it as a as a means of, you know, distributing points based on contributions in

159
00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:28.530
Harold Davis: You know with Project specific, you know, on a project specific basis.

160
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:40.650
Harold Davis: And so it's a it's a very interesting ways of tracking value flows, if, if there's some links there as well. In the update if anybody's interested in you know delving a little bit more into the

161
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:53.190
Harold Davis: Architecture of source credit seems very interesting so far in terms of just what we wanted to do with Jude's original ideas, as you know, you can see with

162
00:21:53.790 --> 00:22:05.070
Harold Davis: These, these screenshots here, the capacity to do some, you know, modest quadratic decision making. But, you know, there's also a ledger there. If you see in the screenshot above

163
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.670
Harold Davis: Let's see if I can get

164
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.070
Harold Davis: Through

165
00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:18.090
Harold Davis: Some type of demo for you guys with the live instance there's a ledger.

166
00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.340
Ryan Arndt: mustaches like

167
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.560
Ryan Arndt: You're still muted.

168
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.490
Harold Davis: Now,

169
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.600
Harold Davis: My screen now. I think I need to move on, guys.

170
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.140
Jenny: Should I stop sharing help. Yeah.

171
00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:35.550
Harold Davis: Yes, sir.

172
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:37.680
Jenny: Okay.

173
00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.370
Jenny: I think you can screen share now.

174
00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:06.270
Harold Davis: Terms might be

175
00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:06.810
Probably

176
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.850
Harold Davis: Some from the screenshots.

177
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.690
Harold Davis: A brief idea of

178
00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.470
Harold Davis: What's possible with the different

179
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:45.090
Harold Davis: Again, and, you know, we can have different you know runs of experiments with plugins GitHub discord artists also set that up and there's also a link there for folks. She stood in a testing that your server.

180
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.770
Harold Davis: Is quite server for this particular or its credit

181
00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.490
Harold Davis: For the, for the voting mechanism graph.

182
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:59.580
Harold Davis: I think it will be, you know, pretty exciting to use one week.

183
00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:05.340
Harold Davis: For you know folks who are interested in like tinkering with

184
00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.330
Harold Davis: What fits our community values in terms of these weights.

185
00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:10.890
Harold Davis: And

186
00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:17.010
Harold Davis: And and play with, you know, strategies of how we can apply it, you know.

187
00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.490
Harold Davis: You know, and maybe at first strictly in a governance.

188
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:28.140
Harold Davis: You know means so unnecessarily using the grain for any testing monetary but

189
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.480
Harold Davis: You know, just using it for tracking value contributions in

190
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.310
Harold Davis: Objects, particularly for that one week we can

191
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:50.700
Harold Davis: You know track the different discussions that are happening around you know green with the weights and then then the next week at the at the it's set up so that

192
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.600
Harold Davis: You know, there's a recalculation of credit every six hours of baby and distribution brain.

193
00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.780
Harold Davis: At Sunday. And there's different

194
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:17.190
Harold Davis: Ways of shipping grain is an immediate distribution mechanism, you know, a balanced vision mechanism, I believe, a recent recent distribution mechanism. And these are to account for, you know,

195
00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.560
Harold Davis: You know, trying to

196
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.570
Harold Davis: Accommodate communities that are just starting up with the immediate

197
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:31.410
Harold Davis: Minimal very or to incentivize immediate contributions.

198
00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:37.320
Harold Davis: And then the balance goes into, you know, you know,

199
00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:49.260
Harold Davis: retroactive things that may be necessary aiming so giving credit where it's deserved or removing creator, where it isn't.

200
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.040
Harold Davis: And using you know unity.

201
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:57.030
Harold Davis: Basically community feedback in

202
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:03.930
Harold Davis: To monitor this is language that source and the source.

203
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:05.070
Jenny: Media has

204
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.030
Harold Davis: Been their approach.

205
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:10.980
Harold Davis: And then the recent I believe is a is another

206
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:20.700
Harold Davis: More recent mechanism that they've come up with to incentivize you know more timely.

207
00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.850
Harold Davis: Grain dishes and

208
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:35.670
Harold Davis: Yeah. So what I figure is that one week of experimentation can go into tinkering with these weights and the next can go into what would be both similar to

209
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:44.610
Harold Davis: A timeframe that we wanted for quorum right dude spoke of the original voting mechanism ideas.

210
00:27:45.690 --> 00:28:04.410
Harold Davis: That two week time frame, you know, kind of serving as that forum where, you know, the first week folks can come into either either one of those plugin areas and contribute and then the next week is like a week's time of contributing

211
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.840
Harold Davis: The decision making in the grain that you earn via

212
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.840
Contributions and

213
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:21.720
Harold Davis: Which we are, these are my ideas that I wanted to propose and give you feedback on the viability of it, uh, you know,

214
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.230
Harold Davis: Strategies that immediately come to mind.

215
00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.580
Harold Davis: So yes, I'm excited about the discourse.

216
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:35.790
Harold Davis: Know possibilities with stacks off as well down the line or

217
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:44.760
Harold Davis: Whatever they could growing in terms of you know what it means for know the important things that go into

218
00:28:45.690 --> 00:29:02.790
Harold Davis: It knowing who is owning and leveraging infrastructure that's already been built to me. So I'm here you see on the GitHub stacks repo loaded here as well as the this cord plugged in. I believe there's nobody there to see no budget.

219
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:15.990
Harold Davis: And from I believe just about everything configuration. I have. It's just that we act in time or something like this in terms of the data that was scraped and just

220
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:17.880
Harold Davis: started the show.

221
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.510
Harold Davis: How it works here hopefully is

222
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:36.540
Harold Davis: Here that there's a little history and so that plays a key part in how exactly the testing happens because a ledger, you can activate users.

223
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:48.870
Harold Davis: Who you know the discourse history, for example, take quite amount of time to load into the instance, because it actually grabs all the data from all the users ever

224
00:29:49.470 --> 00:30:01.350
Harold Davis: And discord and so then you need to know who to activate for more people actually participating in, for example, bits of you actually do a test of this unity.

225
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:04.050
Harold Davis: Oh,

226
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:29.790
Harold Davis: The, the ledger allows you to have ADD identities and ledger. It's true. Give you some admin capacities instance you can activate a new users dissipating make sure that users walk participating contributing grain. For example, you can also merge identities.

227
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:36.990
Harold Davis: You know, for the, for the time where you want to, you know, avoid you know pebble pred

228
00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:38.910
Harold Davis: Your

229
00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:40.950
Harold Davis: Brain distribution.

230
00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:53.220
Harold Davis: So yes, this, this idea of comprehensive the weights movie. I believe that this appear as a reference to authors of different

231
00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:59.610
Harold Davis: Respect, things like razor issues and get hub.

232
00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.670
Harold Davis: Of the covenant in this Court, and

233
00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:15.510
Harold Davis: You know discourse. And so, yes, I can play with this a little bit here and show how it changes.

234
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:20.550
Harold Davis: In real time. The way that the credit is reflected

235
00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.140
Harold Davis: In some crazy

236
00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:32.850
Harold Davis: Weird, but just to to show what's possible. And they also come with default

237
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:38.490
Harold Davis: settings that I have for the source credit

238
00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:41.610
Harold Davis: But

239
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.510
Harold Davis: It's also interesting to think about what we can do.

240
00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:51.330
Harold Davis: Community specific or even strategy specific with these weights.

241
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.710
Harold Davis: Or

242
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:58.410
Harold Davis: No respective quadratic funding or quantitative

243
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:01.860
Harold Davis: So, yes.

244
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.580
Harold Davis: He would need these look like

245
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:14.910
Harold Davis: I've already transferred some tests grain distribute some tech brain as well have checking checking with that tab looks like.

246
00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.370
Harold Davis: Into slow here.

247
00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:31.560
Harold Davis: I'm not lifting it very good have some of them not written, but yes, if there's any questions or suggestions on approaches going forward with

248
00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:39.600
Harold Davis: Will be tested with you. I'm happy to. What about the time again.

249
00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:56.670
Jenny: Alright. Thanks. Hello. This is really, this looks really promising and in that last window with GitHub and discord so grain is essentially like reputation that I'm guessing like it. I don't know if it's like reductive to say that

250
00:32:59.010 --> 00:32:59.220
Harold Davis: Yeah.

251
00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:01.320
Harold Davis: No credit is more than that.

252
00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:05.610
Harold Davis: Because you can actually transfer ground. As you can see down below, but

253
00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:06.570
Jenny: So with

254
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.370
Jenny: And. Okay, good.

255
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:21.780
Jenny: And so in the last window when it was showing GitHub and discord that calculates your contribution across both platforms.

256
00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:30.630
Harold Davis: Right, right. Um, you can you can have even discourse in this in this explorer here.

257
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:34.290
Harold Davis: I have all three plugins loaded at once with the simple adding

258
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.490
Harold Davis: You know, it's just one line of code in the config.

259
00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:43.680
Harold Davis: In the configuration and then you know you're adding one plugin or adding all three plugins.

260
00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:48.780
Harold Davis: So yes, it's a it's nice and that way for non technical folks like myself.

261
00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:59.370
Harold Davis: You know what laid in the Explorer and whatnot, or in this instance is also a malignant, it helps with remember because

262
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:10.170
Harold Davis: They've integrated pages very nicely. I didn't do my work in terms of splitting up the front end. So there's, it's all they've made it nice and transparent in terms of

263
00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:23.520
Harold Davis: When you're not, you know, voting local data, you know, everything transparent in a nice GitHub pages of the for the community terms of all of the same stuff getting pushed

264
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.920
Harold Davis: For us, for example, and I'll have a local report set up for that, but

265
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:41.370
Harold Davis: Oh, we can move it to the stacks of creative stacks good as repo board or it goes through great actual facts.

266
00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:43.200
Harold Davis: And

267
00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:55.530
Jenny: Thank you. I'm more passionate that most seems really excited about this, this looks really promising and anyone else have a question or we move on.

268
00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:08.610
Jason Schrader: Not questions just wanted to say a great job. I think it's really cool to see how this is pulling together the idea being to able to adjust those weights and to play with a lot of those factors and come up with the scores super cool.

269
00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:19.680
Jason Schrader: And to see it running, you know, is it just need. I mean, overall I think you're on a good track if there's anything I can help you with Harold on the integration into GitHub, or we want to look down that option.

270
00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:28.020
Jason Schrader: Will probably throw it up as a as an action item and make sure we got them on it. But aside from that, it was something helpful. I'm definitely happy to help out.

271
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:30.600
Harold Davis: Beautiful, beautiful. Thank you.

272
00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:42.780
Harold Davis: Yeah, I'm yes I'm excited to about it about a company didn't get it running real looking at this quarter very hopeful towards great in terms of course

273
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:54.000
Harold Davis: Yeah, be on the grain here works as well. I want to show you guys it as well. But yes, um,

274
00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:57.990
Harold Davis: If there's any more feedback or questions.

275
00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.580
Jenny: Thank you, Harold.

276
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:14.430
Jenny: Yeah, I do have some questions later about how these translates into votes. Like, I would love to see that demo, but that can be for a later time because I know you're still

277
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.530
Jenny: Experiment with us.

278
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.800
Harold Davis: Yeah. But yeah, actually this page here on

279
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:34.110
Harold Davis: This actually key because, you know, you notice that there's a source code identity here, but it's not actually a person in your GitHub, but what I noticed is that have projects or bots.

280
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:42.210
Harold Davis: In this identity and activate or deactivate them and what I imagined just for simple demonstration of

281
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.640
Harold Davis: Decision making was for

282
00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:53.070
Harold Davis: The community, you know, simple identities can be attached to certain you know you know choice.

283
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:55.740
Harold Davis: Based on the discussions.

284
00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:14.790
Harold Davis: And then folks can send grain to whatever identity, you know, they want to send every exact amount of grain to and that identity would really associated certain decision.

285
00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:23.490
Harold Davis: So that's, that's my DNA, the letter D check and transparent and vice in certain ways.

286
00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:29.460
Jenny: That was it intended it from the beginning. So that's really interesting.

287
00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:35.460
Harold Davis: And it's not the only thing that possible I'd imagine of so I'm excited for

288
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.630
Harold Davis: Actually happened.

289
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:42.840
Harold Davis: During the testing phases, because that's where a lot of the strategies, I'd imagine will come up

290
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:54.240
Harold Davis: And my plan is to hang out in discord hang out and and you know, bring folks into the discord.

291
00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:04.110
Harold Davis: Discord server or bring folks into know discussions, either in either any of the plugins to listen.

292
00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:05.940
Harold Davis: To

293
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.420
Harold Davis: The tape itself. That's the plan.

294
00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:17.160
Ryan Arndt: That can be something that is organized and like we could invite people to come and try it out. Like if you need a bunch of people

295
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:26.100
Harold Davis: Yes, yes I would appreciate any home goes to the organizing as well. I know I was looking for more

296
00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:28.800
Harold Davis: For myself, so

297
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:37.650
Jenny: We can help you that for sure because I think a grant we committed to trying to get 50 people per test, which is actually quite, quite a lot.

298
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:38.700
Jenny: Yeah, um,

299
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.190
Jenny: Yeah so happy to help with that.

300
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:55.020
Jenny: share my screen.

301
00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:58.290
Harold Davis: Alright.

302
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.640
Jenny: Can you all see

303
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:05.850
Jenny: The fish you

304
00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:08.250
Ryan Arndt: Still see Harold's

305
00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:14.940
Harold Davis: I'm trying to stop sharing, but I got, I will bless

306
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.400
Ryan Arndt: Problem for a kindergarten class, we're

307
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:42.630
Ryan Arndt: Not sharing the one stop sharing click stop someone else.

308
00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:50.250
Jenny: Supposedly I've stopped sharing his screen, but I don't think that's the case.

309
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:51.450
Ryan Arndt: Yeah, no, it's still there.

310
00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.840
Ryan Arndt: But if you try to share yours, Jenny, will it come back up and replace it.

311
00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.810
Jenny: Why just did that. Anything see lines.

312
00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:04.500
See

313
00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:06.540
Harold Davis: Just leave

314
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.490
Jenny: leave and come back. That's fine. You can do that.

315
00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:25.770
Jason Schrader: Host You should have an option to stop the screen share

316
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.670
Jenny: I have done it several times.

317
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.280
Of course, of course.

318
00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:37.530
Jenny: Maybe

319
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:40.770
Jenny: It sounds so funny. Maybe you should leave Harold

320
00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:44.130
Jenny: Come back.

321
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:57.480
Ryan Arndt: It is silly thing happened with the ecosystem call today where there's somebody coming on being loud and I unmuted them.

322
00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:08.640
Ryan Arndt: Thought it was thinking it was a meeting for everybody on the call. But it didn't it just merely for me. So the person who is still talking and I didn't even know. So feel free to discard Hangouts.

323
00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:11.550
Jenny: And

324
00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:12.600
As

325
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:16.200
Jenny: I can you guys see my god

326
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:17.820
Ryan Arndt: Will hero.

327
00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.310
Jenny: We can still see Harold screen.

328
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.770
Jenny: Yes. This is nuts.

329
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.540
Ryan Arndt: There you go.

330
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:30.810
Jason Schrader: Okay, just cleared for me and I've got nothing.

331
00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:32.190
Jenny: Alright, cool.

332
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:36.390
Ryan Arndt: Very good. Oh wait, that's helped screen, really. No, it's not. It's not.

333
00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:38.190
Jason Schrader: Nope. Nope, it's right.

334
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:39.240
Ryan Arndt: Okay, listen.

335
00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.760
Jenny: It doesn't even say that my screen sharing

336
00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.440
Jason Schrader: So what do you see on screen. Yeah.

337
00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:47.910
Jason Schrader: Grab your screen, we can just also see what was on his screen.

338
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:53.100
Jenny: Okay.

339
00:41:56.010 --> 00:42:05.070
Jenny: Okay, cool. Thank you for that, Harold. Um, I think I will. Julian. It also i don't think that she updated this, but she said she will be updating

340
00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:07.080
Jenny: Her

341
00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:17.250
Jenny: Project progress over the next few days, so you can keep an eye on that as core channel for that and got two minutes left, so we can move through these quickly.

342
00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:22.980
Jenny: This to know for you to discuss this with Jason you've made it as part of your grant.

343
00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:24.720
Jenny: Update.

344
00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:28.620
Jason Schrader: Every day, so that's that's going to be a part of it. And I would

345
00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:33.720
Jason Schrader: Just like to get some ideas out I'll probably throw a block survey out as I get closer to that milestone to

346
00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.160
Jenny: Get some input from people

347
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:43.770
Jason Schrader: Just following the general stacks guidelines. But if anybody has a really cool idea or something they'd like to see definitely encourage them to throw it in there and it will be reviewed.

348
00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:46.050
Jenny: Okay.

349
00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:53.910
Jenny: Great, thank you. Um, this collaboration with minigolf. It sounds like we do. We have made some progress there via Harold

350
00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:57.060
Jenny: Jensen. Anything you want to add there.

351
00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:09.330
Harold Davis: No, no. Just, just what I mentioned before about, you know, getting the process attended yesterday and planning to present very, very soon in terms of

352
00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:32.130
Harold Davis: You know, they offered to to integrate a wide chat, which is readers application into their list of integrations, which was, I believe, discourse was one of the more recent on the list. So it'll be exciting to see where that goes. And how long it will take when I should have some using this

353
00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:51.060
Jenny: And this proposal, we've talked about putting this on some sort of backlog before, since this person who wrote it doesn't attend the calls. What do you all think we should do it. I know it's an interesting idea. I don't want to move on, anytime soon. Oh.

354
00:43:52.050 --> 00:44:03.060
Jason Schrader: Yeah, I think we can keep it there as an interesting idea. The bigger question that brings up for me is, do we want a process where things go stale and they have to be reopened, or how do we keep things active

355
00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.510
Jason Schrader: So what I'll do is I'm actually creating an action item now.

356
00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:14.460
Jason Schrader: That will fold into the part of the grant procedures and we'll just look a little more into that as a concept and get a phone, as a group, but

357
00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:16.500
Jenny: My feeling is that we can use something

358
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:27.450
Jason Schrader: Like a stale bought that says there's been no activity for X amount of days this he will be closed and why amount of days, unless somebody replies and you can always reopen issues so

359
00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:29.760
Jenny: I'm going to go back and go fix it.

360
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:35.670
Jason Schrader: And I think that makes sense. But I'll throw that out in a format that's easy, that I guess for next week's meeting.

361
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.250
Jenny: Thank you, Jason.

362
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:50.100
Jenny: These are also part of your grant bad backlog case in publisher and Secretary can give any context there.

363
00:44:52.590 --> 00:45:03.750
Jason Schrader: So those were just originally talking more about what roles different community members could have and possibly putting in some sort of structure for reward or just a way to help keep things moving.

364
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:12.330
Jason Schrader: And other than that, I don't think we need to dig into them again and just kind of looking down this list on the backlog stuff too. So we've got

365
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.930
Jason Schrader: A

366
00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:18.360
Jason Schrader: It was a working group roadmap, we're integrating that into what we're doing. Same with like shared resources.

367
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:32.430
Jason Schrader: And languages and translations. So a lot of those are just going to be progress as far as the grant goes it's under the stacks grants repo number 30 if anybody check on it. Otherwise, I think we can kind of gloss over anything this market backlog.

368
00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:45.150
Jenny: Right. Great. So that leaves these to the town hall and the fireside chat series, I can give a little background on the town hall. So I think originally we had talked about hosting a town hall.

369
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:55.440
Jenny: Specifically for specifically by the governance working group. So it would be more community oriented. I will say that after the launch of

370
00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:04.350
Jenny: May net. I don't think it makes sense for hero to continue hosting the town halls, that might be something that falls under the foundation

371
00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:23.550
Jenny: And the most likely it would. So the process for hosting a town hall would be the same. However, I think this does open it up to be more community focused nothing. It's not more community focus now but there's a lot of internal coordination coordination before that. So, this is

372
00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.630
Jenny: Potentially an opportunity for the governance group to get involved.

373
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:36.450
Jenny: Or it could just be something that falls under the foundation, but if anyone has any strong feelings about like absorbing the town halls that we normally have

374
00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:52.560
Jenny: As they are the clip, you know, and if this is something separate from like the usual ecosystem town hall like we want a specific one for governance and you know that's also something worth considering. But does anyone have any strong feelings about the kind of town holidays.

375
00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:11.400
Jason Schrader: Or anything like that. I think the idea was just to have a town hall, you know and and to really get some more information out to help kind of build and grow that community and just big issue with it being a part of that change that I think it'll go well with

376
00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:21.540
Jenny: Um, yeah, I mean one compromise is having making sure that there is a fixed governance section is that monthly town hall.

377
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:29.460
Jenny: Which would sort of put the onus on us to have regular updates and to be able to have

378
00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:35.700
Jenny: To be very transparent with the community about what what we're doing. So that's something to consider.

379
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:50.250
Ryan Arndt: Something like what the sex is called like we're monthly or every two weeks, right, one that one early in the month is what the evangelists and then the the middle of the month. One is just, it's smaller, essentially.

380
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.920
Ryan Arndt: It's just the lead. So we could put the governance from with that.

381
00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:57.720
Ryan Arndt: So just be like evangelist one week governance next fabulous coming so just rotate

382
00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:03.210
Jenny: Yeah, that's good idea. Um, do you want to add a note at the bottom of this.

383
00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.190
Ryan Arndt: To 68

384
00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:08.580
Jenny: Right.

385
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:10.110
Jenny: On

386
00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:16.740
Jenny: That one. Do I

387
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:30.450
Jenny: Fireside Chat series. So at the beginning of the call. We talked about, just in general, the different work streams that this group is focusing on those include obviously Jason's work.

388
00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:41.550
Jenny: With the grant and updating a lot of our standard operating procedures and there's work that he'll just doing for the voting mechanism. The work that Juliet is doing.

389
00:48:42.420 --> 00:49:00.990
Jenny: For the code of conduct, I would count work on the auto moderation bots as definitely related to governance, so I know we're all plugging away at those things I wanted to bring up the, the idea of us like taking more on this quarter. We don't have to, but

390
00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:15.240
Jenny: If we feel strongly about like governance related goals. This is probably a good meeting to start talking about that. And so, you know, we've talked about the fireside chat series for a while now in terms of like

391
00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:23.460
Jenny: Making governance more of a thing that the community is involved in this could potentially be a way to get the more involved.

392
00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:32.820
Jenny: Taking responsibility of have a fireside chat series that we host monthly bringing in external speakers, getting people thinking about governance issues in general.

393
00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:44.280
Jenny: So that could be something that we take on or if this is lower priority, there's totally room for other ideas for projects that we can or new goals that we can take on what do y'all think

394
00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:51.930
Harold Davis: Yeah, I think it's a great idea to

395
00:49:52.320 --> 00:50:05.010
Harold Davis: Give it some priority on, you know, digital age. I think this is a good way to bring folks in social media wise as well, especially if the speakers have followings of their own or

396
00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:15.810
Harold Davis: If you know folks in the community already or, you know, have a particular interest in in folks that were speaking to. I know. Shannon is

397
00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:31.380
Harold Davis: taught myself a lot just through having some pretty amazing speakers from the space cutlery learn 90% of what I know just from what she's organized to the US. So I think it's a very powerful means of

398
00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:35.580
Harold Davis: Getting folks involved and excited so

399
00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:38.940
Jenny: Okay.

400
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:42.660
Jenny: I do too. I've learned so much from the the thoughts.

401
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:45.720
Jenny: Executive school really

402
00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:51.720
Jenny: Any other thoughts about the fireside chat series.

403
00:50:54.840 --> 00:51:02.160
Jason Schrader: I thought it's been a great idea, since it first came out was the, you know, who could we really have some of these deeper discussions with and I know Harold's

404
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:09.540
Jason Schrader: Gone out and reached out to a lot of really good contacts just really, it's been working with already. So I'd love to see it become a reality.

405
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:14.160
Jason Schrader: Obviously this this week with everything going on my brains like know where things

406
00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:22.710
Jason Schrader: Are things, but I do see some room, you know, for some good grief group effort towards things like this. And what would the structure of the town hall be

407
00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:36.480
Jason Schrader: You know, you could tie into the community board. See, because then the community board members, maybe I want to talk to the town hall or you know there's there's a lot of these little pieces that I think we're really close to integrating them together. And this is what I'm particularly

408
00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:45.750
Ryan Arndt: This could be something that some promoted by the foundation to, I think, like if you had someone, and I think Shannon would be able to get some great people to

409
00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:50.640
Ryan Arndt: To Ted. So I think there's a lot of possibilities with this kind of thing.

410
00:51:51.300 --> 00:52:03.870
Jenny: Yeah, for sure. Okay, so what I think we are in a stronger position to float this idea and consider it. And one thing that we talked about in the business a little group on Monday is

411
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:15.600
Jenny: That you know what these working groups. It's really easy to sort of lose focus because everybody or as a group to lose focus are not have direction because everyone's working on their own individual projects which totally makes sense.

412
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:26.820
Jenny: But using these groups as a space for community members to always learn about that specific category of stuff is a good way to keep those working groups going. So what I mean by that is

413
00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:33.330
Jenny: Like, Dan, I had a really good discussion about how we want to move forward with the business models group.

414
00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:39.480
Jenny: This this quarter. And, you know, regardless of whether group members are working on their own things.

415
00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:47.790
Jenny: We can always have. We can have a set agenda of topics that we're going to discuss. And so if you're a new community member and you're interested in business models have

416
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:58.050
Jenny: An agenda to look forward to. So you can say, like, I'm going to attend on February 14 Valentine's Day, because I'm lonely and also just kidding, because I want to learn about

417
00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:04.200
Jenny: Like social media strategy for for promoting my my app so

418
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:13.110
Jenny: Determining topics that we know the community would be interested in in planning agenda and agenda ahead of time. I think that's, you know, something that

419
00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:19.380
Jenny: That we could do with this Fireside Chat series. So for people who are unsure on the fence governance.

420
00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:27.540
Jenny: But are interested in joining they could see our agenda ahead of time and say like, Oh, I can go to this talk by Harold like notice talk by Ronnie clash.

421
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:32.820
Jenny: In February, that's a good way for me to ease into governance in the stack ecosystem. So

422
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:40.020
Jenny: Yeah, perhaps something that's something that we can consider doing and putting out there for the community and we can, we would obviously continue to have our

423
00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:48.060
Jenny: Own working group meetings and continue working together on our projects, but having something external facing for community is a good way to draw them in.

424
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:53.340
Ryan Arndt: That sounds good that this could be the meat and potatoes for a full

425
00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:56.610
Jenny: Yeah, exactly.

426
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:09.660
Jenny: Okay, I see that we are at title. We're over time. So I want to be mindful of that. And there anything else that we want to cover a

427
00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.230
Jenny: Discussion items or questions before we

428
00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:17.490
Jenny: Move on it and then we can talk about next steps to just to wrap things up.

429
00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:21.600
Jason Schrader: I am good at my son.

430
00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:26.430
Jenny: Okay, cool.

431
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:28.080
Jenny: Alright, so the next step.

432
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:33.840
Jenny: Will just sort of that at the very first thing we should do is just give a quick rundown and

433
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:40.860
Jenny: Governance channel about you know what everyone's working on some thoughts from this meeting, so everyone can catch up sympathize.

434
00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:52.950
Jenny: After coming back from the holidays. So we'll plan to meet in two weeks from now and then two weeks from now we're going to be an in an entirely different worlds, because it will have launched so

435
00:54:54.060 --> 00:55:09.090
Jenny: I don't think that there's any pressure on us to make any decisions or or deliver anything in the next few weeks, just because we're going to have a lot more to talk about. After the main launch it. So that would be my take on on next steps. Sounds good.

436
00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:13.740
Harold Davis: Yes, like to comment. Yeah.

437
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:15.090
Jason Schrader: Sounds good to me.

438
00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:23.820
Jenny: Cool thanks everyone really setting up a 13 year old for that demo, I'm so excited about the voting mechanism. Thanks for all your work there.

439
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:27.690
Ryan Arndt: Hey,

440
00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:30.630
Jason Schrader: Did you all

441
00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:34.530
Jason Schrader: Have a great, great next two weeks is fun things happen.

442
00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.180
Jenny: Yeah, see you later.

443
00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:37.320
Bye.
