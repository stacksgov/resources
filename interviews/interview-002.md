# Stakeholder Interview 2

*   What’s your role?
    *   Getting to know community well enough that I can develop effective strategies for growing the community and engaging/activating the community
    *   Blockstack has a really broad community of interested stakeholders, but for a while it operated like a brand community - a platform people were excited about, they came to us about features
    *   but didn’t really come to us as much about getting involved, even if they’re talented/intellectually curious/have overlap in interests
    *   It’s interesting and challenging, getting to know people, find out how they want to step up and take charge
    *   This year, been building on momentum from PoX, concerns or response to pausing of app mining
    *   People can tell there’s a shift in focus and what we’re building, there’s still a lot confidence and trust
    *   We’ve made it clear to community members that they’re playing a huge role in that - my job is to facilitate that genuine collaboration
    *   Nebulous role but focused on community
*   Why is there confidence and trust?
    *   Despite the fact that the team hasn’t flexed that open source muscle as much - having a system of working alongside community - we are in touch w the community regularly
    *   Make a lot of time for personalized communication
    *   Not just pushing out a blog, newsletter, etc. - those things are valuable and we need to do them
    *   Muneeb spends a lot of time in telegram personally answering questions
    *   We started having town halls - fairly new
    *   Hasn’t been systematized but when they hear from us it is personal and our messaging puts them first
    *   Bonds they make with each other are strong - you see the friendships at the blockstack summit - these community members talk to each other a lot
    *   Where else in the world will they find someone who has been through the challenges of app mining? Only here
    *   Element of trust must come from being very principled as a company
    *   Can’t Be Evil campaign resonates w people, pursuing transparency in SEC work - we spent a lot of time and money on this process - want to make us and what were doing more accessible
    *   I’ve heard from community member, and I agree, this is an inclusive community, relative to other crypto communities
    *   We didn’t have regular community managers until last summer - so people were monitoring themselves - that’s pretty special
    *   Even I’m trying to work on having a formalized code of conduct, finding a way for community members to enforce that - we have some incidences of people being unpleasant - but people being outright unpleasant are new, trolling is new
    *   Real community members don’t troll. They’ve taken the time to go through our docs and are focused on other things, i.e., building on Blockstack.
*   How has governance run up to now?
    *   App mining - but this example carries across the project
        *   An idea that was heavily researched and developed by PBC team
        *   Evolution of app mining was interactive: very vocal community members were involved in suggesting improvements, but they were looking to PBC to make the decision
        *   If enough people were vocal about something, we could take that into account - or about something they did like
        *   It seemed more one-sided than where we’re trying to go
        *   There were some technical things with judging - people could easily spam Twitter or other social media with app name - that could count for Awario - so we got better about that scoring.
        *   When people figured out that people were gaming the app mining program, they raised it and it would be immediately addressed - crowdsourcing to detect gaming - community would self-police. People very vocal about perceived injustices, vocal about banning people or changing judging criteria.
    *   But we really value community input, and are happy to change decisions based on what community members are saying, what they want
    *   Where we want to go is community members suggesting things, not immediately coming to PBC team members, they have processes and procedures and resources for those ideas without needing to come to me or to the team at all
*   Going forward
    *   I’d want governance to empower community members to build things on their own
    *   There’s been so much good engagement on app mining. We asked for proposals, got a lot of great feedback, but also got a lot of thoughts and opinions about how it should be done or what’s fair/not fair. Good to have that kind of discussion, but I was hoping to see more community members saying, clearly this is easily gameable, I wonder what I have to learn to understand why it’s easily gameable - game theory involved - I organized a game theory call for community members to understand basics
    *   Would want to see people doing research, sharing it: “this key element of app mining program is faulty, I propose we swap it out for this idea instead, here’s why and here’s the research that backs it up, here’s next steps, here’s how we facilitate it” - more thorough!
    *   Right now this falls on PBC, it’s time/resource intensive, we’re happy to do it, but would be great if community could do more
    *   Gov. model that caters to this would be one that lays out clear processes for building support, resources for ideas that have clear support
    *   Self-policing a community: processes you can put in place that don’t involve law enforcement! Self-sovereignty, this is what our community cares a lot about.
*   What else?
    *   How automated can we make governance? This is interesting.
    *   I can see where these people are coming from
    *   I think you need a social element, and you need people to enforce an effective governance model.
    *   What has worked for other projects in terms of rotating contributors? Even for something small as a GitHub repo — how do you make sure the community members who take it over don’t monopolize it?
    *   In first draft of governance proposal I’d like to see a very good idea for how to give everyone a say, implement time/term limits - make sure they’re actually doing their part, that you can rely on them
    *   People talk about voting a lot, there are lots of ideas out there
    *   As a small community only a few people offer ideas, easy to vote
    *   If you have 100 people volunteering to maintain a repo, how do community members vote on their representatives?
    *   I don’t have super strong opinions about how this should work, it’s about what the community thinks
    *   I’m always tempted to jump in to these convos - will it make the rich richer? Should you need STX? What if you don’t have any? I have lots of opinions about these
    *   Balancing act - leading from behind - while being open to the will of the community - this is “good stewardship"
*   What else?
    *   How community management would work under this future governance model
    *   People feel like decentralization is really far away, and having an operational governance model is also far away, so we need a dedicated community person to make sure things are on track
    *   But if we are decentralized, people are engaged/empowered to do their work? Is there a liaison?
    *   I would want that to be laid out
    *   How will this role evolve? Vis-a-vis new entities, processes, etc.
    *   New entities that can exist - we talk about possibility of lots of new entities to spin up out of community - I imagine this process could be quite complicated - entities have resources, adhere to certain principles
    *   What’s the constitution - guiding/overarching principles? for all these entities
*   How do you define a stakeholder? Where do we draw the line?
    *   I understand POV that stakeholder literally has to hold STX tokens, but I think a lot of community members don’t for financial or other reasons, but have contributed to growth of ecosystem/community, and I think I’d count them as stakeholders too because they do work/put in effort to advance ecosystem
    *   In future, whether we count non-STX holders, a stakeholder needs to be someone willing to share not only in benefits but also in risks and failures
    *   Stakeholder theory - Mariana Mazzucato - what’s happened in US economy recently - increasing privatization of benefits, socialization of risks, e.g., big bank bailouts
    *   If you’re a stakeholder you have to be willing to take the downside too
    *   App mining was super valuable, it’s paused at the moment, it’s not what we wanted it to be, but learnings were so invaluable
        *   I hope we can work with the community to come up with a better version of App Mining soon - we learned what we needed to learn to run a better version in future
    *   Some people got payouts, some may feel like they lost out, but that’s to be expected from something experimental
    *   I hope our community is one that understands that dynamic, that to be a stakeholder it’s not just upside, there are risks we take to move the ecosystem forward, and if they don’t work, we just move forward
    *   Kinda like how the state runs (or used to run)
    *   I tried to remind the community that Tesla got its start from a $550M loan from the government
    *   A stakeholder is someone who understands the risks of participation - want ppl to take that seriously
    *   Is there anyone you’d exclude?
        *   Don’t quote me on this as my final answer but I’ve been thinking about this. In the future I’d exclude passive app users who don’t hold STX.
        *   I count people actively contributing to community, STX holders, developers, app users using STX for apps - there’s a direct contribution to the community
        *   If you’re a passive user, just DL an app, not really providing feedback - although those people have potential to grow into genuine stakeholders - but I wouldn’t lose sleep over that
    *   Should we make progress on our mission, user-owned internet, it would/could affect everyone
    *   My thought: we draw lines today but can make room for an arbitrarily large set of people
*   App mining - not what we wanted it to be
    *   From what I know, when we set out to implement this program, the idea was to have an algorithmic program that could easily evaluate app quality and scale to hundreds of thousands of apps - through many iterations it was clear that’s a huge challenge
    *   In other community proposals, they’re suggesting we get real people involved - maybe not possible to automate it - people always have to be involved in that process
    *   Personally I don’t think it has to be automated - that would be nice but there’s always nuance when it comes to projects that people put time and effort into - to have something spit out a score for an app that took years, has the potential to become really good - this could be unfair, you can’t please everyone, just because they put work into it
    *   Community member brought this up, it’s a good point - there’s a distinction between incentivizing good app development, and rewarding devs just for building apps, vs. grants or bounties - there’s a certain amount for a project that achieves this, who can build this?
    *   Right incentives, not just rewards program
*   What is good governance?
    *   Has processes in place to always take into account those who are the worst off
    *   Could be programs, subsidies, social mobility programs in general. Those would be laid out, accessible to those who are worst off.
    *   This invokes images of people in poverty but in our case it could be those without STX - is there a way for them to get STX? To become stakeholders quickly.
    *   Good governance would take that into account.
    *   Good governance by default can build diverse communities
        *   In crypto there’s a lot of discussion about diversity issues
        *   Community advisory boards - criteria for people getting elected takes into account diversity - has to ensure that the people on the board have varying amounts of STX holdings, come from very different backgrounds
        *   Can’t think of a PC way to describe it but it would be built into the criteria for representative positions
        *   As an example - in traditional way people talk about diversity, identity, don’t have to talk about this - look at passive app users who don’t have STX - maybe we should reserve a position for that kind of person, a voice from someone on the fence about joining. Maybe this is a bad example but it’s a thought experiment that would be good for everyone to do.
        *   If this “passive app user” represents a group that could convert to full-time users.
*   What are our mission/values/etc.?
    *   I’m a big proponent of building a user-owned/controlled Internet
    *   For me what that means is shifting the power dynamic s.t. users are the ones in control of their identities, data, and digital assets
    *   Ownership is a complicated thing, I don’t love idea of “grow internet ownership” b/c it doesn’t mean anything to a lot of people - until you start talking about things like home ownership - who in our society has full ownership over their property?
    *   Three-pronged: digital assets, hope you have full control over these; data, would be better if you have full control; identity, e.g., Balaji talks about pseudonymity (not sure how I feel about this) but you want it to be the case that your ID is yours and no one can ever commit fraud in your name or whatever
    *   these things need to be in place to have true ownership and self-sovereignty
    *   The mission of the project - which has grown to encompass many things - is to build a user-owned internet
    *   What that looks like in future? Thriving economy, users have a say as opposed to just big tech
    *   What about shared values?
        *   Can’t be evil engineering principles
            *   #1 Ownership > Access
            *   #2 Safety > Convenience
            *   #3 Permissionless > Trust
            *   #4 Incentives > Enforcement
            *   #5 Cautious > Agile
        *   Privacy or at the very least transparency
        *   People always talk about privacy, a big value is transparency, want to know what I’m getting into/where my data is going
        *   Ownership of data and private keys
        *   Safety and security over accessibility - dealing with inconvenience of web3 products now, tradeoff being that you know what’s happening to your data
    *   Esp. with PoX - there might be newer values people talk about - but values that have resonated most are under this can’t be evil umbrella
*   What else should I have asked you?
    *   What role does PBC team play in decentralization?
        *   Sometimes we say, “Not much will change” (in the near future)
        *   But don’t know if that’s the case
        *   I think we’d continue to focus on product offering - developer tools
        *   Being active contributors to the product - but "just another open source contributor”
    *   I’m very curious about that.
    *   Stakeholder theory - there’s some uptake on that idea in the community - but what expectations do community members have for decentralization? E.g., roles to grow into
    *   I often talk about decentralization as PBC members working more collaboratively with community members as if we’re on one big team - in a company you talk about sharing in profit, revenue, salary, etc. - and I think, what are the community members’ expectations?
